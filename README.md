# Turbopedia 

Turbopedia is a simple web application that allows users to learn about the current Formula 1 drving scene by simply typing in a driver's name or a name of a race circuit. 
This application works by requesting data from OpenF1 API (https://openf1.org/) and reads the json files from the API's response. After processing, the application gathers
appropriate information and a picture of the driver and race circuit requested and manipulates the HTML and CSS of the website for the user to observe. 

This project was made by myself and presented to judges at UT's Formula Hacks Hackathon under the Best Racing Hack Category in Spring 2024. Through this project I learned how to consume data from an API with JavaScript.

Application was constructed with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

A demo can be seen here:

The web application was deployed with Vercel:
